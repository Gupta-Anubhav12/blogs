- then you'll need to login to wakatime.com for the real time coding data api
there register and configure with your favourite IDE / editor for example in VS code you need to add just an extension and then API key from the account settings.<br>
Then share the embeddable codes from share option 
it'll look something like this
![here](https://i.postimg.cc/02fJYH0L/Whats-App-Image-2021-01-17-at-00-56-42.jpg)

and share the **SVG** Embeddable codes 
the fields in the form are labelled as languages and activity <br>
add the url there

the script will look like this <br>
```<figure><embed src="https://wakatime.com/share/@65a0da28-4527-47b7-b807-c840daf5a500/955351a7-2832-478b-8efc-d45a10774cba.svg"></embed></figure>```
we need only the url in src=" **this part only** "
for above example it goes as 
```https://wakatime.com/share/@65a0da28-4527-47b7-b807-c840daf5a500/955351a7-2832-478b-8efc-d45a10774cba.svg```

do same for both activity and languages

## Now for the projects part 
each project needs these fields :
- title
- description
- link
- image

## Experience Needs This 
- Post
- company / Organization
- description
- image

## education needs
- name 
- institute
- image
- link
---
----------------------
Now the website is still in it's initial phase hence we can not provide staff credentials to all to avoid things going crazy
all the members can write to us at ludhianatechcom@gmail.com or DM me(Anubhav)
yet most of people interested can get the access from me directly till we add authentication and profile parts
the website is still in development stage and we hope to see a great resource out of this ,

### Future of realdevils.com
I personally would love to make this a platform with online IDE integrated for fun competitions and some leaderboards along with pesonal dashboards and scoring ,
Tech Blogs are there yet we need a lot of work to be done Newletter is ready but is on hold for content . <br>
a lot of possibilities yet we can aspire and remain creative to achieve them
stay Creative <br>
