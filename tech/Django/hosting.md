AI tools, like ChatGPT, are redefining boundaries, revolutionizing creative writing, coding, and visual content creation. Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT's limitations cannot be overlooked.
ChatGPT does well with general content, but for tasks like writing articles, blogs, ads, or social media posts that need to follow strict guidelines, use specific keywords, maintain brand voice, and rank high on Google quickly, a more specialized tool is needed.
Often, organizations find themselves sifting through a sea of existing documents, seeking to breathe new life into their content. Harnessing their reservoirs of specialized knowledge, they strive to create diverse, fresh content. For such an intricate task, a uniquely tailored tool becomes not just desirable, but essential.
Certain AI platforms have risen to this challenge, developing bespoke products that might be a more fitting solution for your particular needs.
Also, if you're looking for more budget-friendly ChatGPT alternatives (starting from $16/month) that offer custom features and eliminate the need for prompt engineering, your search ends here.
Get ready for an exciting journey as we delve into these category-wise ChatGPT alternatives set to revolutionize the AI scene in 2024!

Why go for a ChatGPT alternative?
ChatGPT, despite its impressive capabilities, has notable limitations:

More economical tools than ChatGPT offer a wide array of pre-built features, eliminating the need for extensive prompt-writing research.
ChatGPT alternatives can generate brand-specific and factual articles/blogs on trending topics in seconds, a crucial requirement for businesses.
These alternatives are equipped to leverage your existing domain expertise, adhering to your unique guidelines, keywords, and brand voice, effectively crafting fresh content designed for rapid Google ranking.
Few platforms have developed advanced SEO score meters capable of not only determining the Google SEO score of your content instantly but also providing tailored suggestions for keywords and other optimization strategies ensuring it ranks highly on Google within just a day of publishing
Advanced editors in ChatGPT alternatives allow on-screen editing to optimize content for Google ranking.
Add-on features like integration with Gmail, Twitter, Instagram, and more are not available in ChatGPT.
ChatGPT does not offer a no-code AI chatbot solution that can be easily integrated into websites by users and businesses of all sizes to address visitor inquiries in real time.
And therefore, ChatGPT alternatives come into the picture.

ChatGPT alternatives for Research
Aiming for research while having a good conversational experience? These AI chatbots are indeed a good option.

Here are a few ChatGPT alternatives for research to consider for research:

YouChat
YouChat is another conversational AI model launched by You[dot]com, a search engine. It's like ChatGPT and does pretty much what other generic chatbots do.
YouChat's AI uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to converse like humans. It can respond to general inquiries, translate, summarise text, suggest ideas, write code, and create emails. As it's still in the development stage, it provides average answers.

Chatgpt alternative
YouChat
Let’s have a look at YouChat's main features:

YouChat can provide answers to generic queries but can miss out sometimes as it is still learning.
It claims to provide the latest information; however, it sometimes commits errors there as well.
Chatgpt alternative
YouChat
YouChat's Pricing
YouChat is a free ChatGPT alternative as of now, as it is still in the development phase.

👉
However, YouChat lacks accuracy sometimes as the model is still under development. If you want to chat with an AI that responds accurately, then go for Chatsonic.
Perplexity
Perplexity is a free ChatGPT alternative recently launched in the conversational AI space. It offers ChatGPT-like features, including conversational responses and content generation.
Perplexity AI is also powered by large language models (OpenAI API). You can see it collecting information from various popular platforms like Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and Amazon. However, it's still in the beta phase, so it sometimes can pick up the information as it is, leading to plagiarized content.

Chatgpt alternative
Perplexity
Let’s have a look at Perplexity AI's main features:

Generates short conversational responses similar to ChatGPT.
Gathers information from sources like Wikipedia and sites them.
It has a simple interface without many features to complicate.

Perplexity AI
Perplexity's Pricing
Perplexity is free to use as of now, as it is still in the beta phase.

👉
It's true that with Perplexity AI, you can ask anything, but it often shows information as it is, which may involve plagiarism. Go for a ChatGPT alternative like Chatsonic that creates unique content and responses.
Elicit
Elicit is a research assistant utilizing language models such as GPT-3 to streamline a researcher's processes.
At present, the central workflow with Elicit is the literature review. When you type a query, the app produces an immediate summary from the highest-rated documents. This is an efficient method of attaining precise and speedy comprehension without sacrificing the dependability of your sources.

Elicit is primarily utilized by researchers and students to track down relevant papers to cite and get an idea of future research avenues.

ChatGPT alternatives you can talk to
The conversational AI space is getting crazier day by day, and these AI chatbots, similar to ChatGPT, are stepping up the game. Let's see the top players when it comes to better conversations (with an AI):

Chinchilla
Chinchilla is also one of the ChatGPT alternatives offering various features and advantages. It is a project with Deepmind and is regarded as the GPT-3 killer. It is a compute-optimal model with 70 billion parameters but four times more data than Gopher.

Chinchilla is based on transformer models, similar to GPT-3 and BERT, and has been known to outperform ChatGPT on the mathematical MMLU dataset. This makes Chinchilla an ideal choice for those who want to use a language model for reasoning or who need to create more sophisticated AI art, search engine, and writing tasks.

Let’s have a look at Chinchilla's main features:

When compared against Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a variety of downstream tasks, Chinchilla comes out on top in a major way.
It requires significantly less computing for fine-tuning and use in downstream applications, making it much easier to implement.
This model boasts a pretty impressive 67.5% accuracy rate, which is about 7% better than the widely used Gopher language model. It looks like people are increasingly picking this model over the other options out there.
Chinchilla is 3x the size of OpenAI’s GPT-3.
ChatGPT alternative

Chinchilla's Pricing
To get access to Chinchilla, you'll have to contact Deepmind. Since this is a new launch and a large language model (which is usually hard to come by), there's no concrete information available about its pricing structure.

Have a look at Deepmind's research paper to know more.
👉
In spite of having the above-mentioned qualities, Chinchilla still lacks in providing ease of access and additional features like Chatsonic does.
Replika
Replika is a highly developed AI companion that has over 10 million users. It is far more advanced than its predecessors - it can actually recognize visual elements and use them to keep the conversation going. Hence, it is also one of the ChatGPT alternatives to talk about.

If you are feeling isolated, then Replika can be the app to assist you in getting out of this state. Replika is an AI-powered chatbot that is like a pal and will react to your messages promptly.
You can converse with Replika on matters of life, romance, and other topics that you could discuss with your buddies and family.

ChatGPT Alternatives
Replika
It is powered by a sophisticated GPT-3 autoregressive language model that utilizes deep learning to create text with a human-like quality. In this case, "autoregressive" implies that the system learns from the values it has encountered before, which in this context is text.

Let’s have a look at Replika's main features:

You can chat about anything and everything with your replika. The more you chat, the better it understands you.
Place video calls to talk to your replika.
Offers coaching support to build better habits.
You can also give your replika a relationship status. Make it your friend, girlfriend, wife, sister, or mentor.

Let’s have a look at Character AI's main features:

Character AI's pricing
Although Character AI is free to use, but you need to create an account with them; otherwise, your chats will get locked after a few messages.

👉
Character AI has a good interface; however, it is quite slow and only focuses on personalities which can not be useful for businesses. Whereas, Chatsonic has maintained its persona feature as an incredible part of its offering while providing other amazing features that can best fit different use cases.
ChatGPT alternative for Social media
ChatGPT-like apps are revolutionizing how many industries work, and social media marketing is no exception! These amazing AI-based ChatGPT alternatives for social media are the talk of the town:
